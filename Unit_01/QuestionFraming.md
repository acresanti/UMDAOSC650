# Welcome!

### What is the goal of this course?

My goal is that you leave this course with a sufficient foundation on neural networks (NNs), where

- you can understand related scientific papers and talks, 
- you can determine whether they would be useful for your research question, and 
- you can determine which class of NNs would be best suited for your problem.

### Learning outcomes:

- Students will be able to prepare their physical science data for neural network workflows and choose preprocessing methods based on the characteristics of their data and problem.
- Students will be able to describe neural network architectures of various types and identify which neural network and type of learning would be appropriate for certain applications in the physical sciences.
- Students will be able to detect when neural networks have overfit to the training data and identify when learning has gone wrong by describing what neural networks have learned and performing robust hyperparameter grid searching and optimization.

Iâ€™ve purposefully structured this course so that you will get out of it what you put into it. 

Lectures will help, your class project will help, but asking questions and pushing yourself to apply NNs to your real-world data will be key to your expertise.
