# Data exploration, preprocessing, labels, and dimensionality reduction

### Importance of Data

### What is your data type?

Nature of your “labels” (i.e., predictand or y)

- Pixel (i.e., grid cell or point value), e.g., artificial neural network (dense layers).
- Image-based (i.e., spatial region), e.g., convolutional neural network.
- Temporal (i.e., time series), e.g., recurrent neural network.
